            "Here are 5 interesting facts about black holes:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Black Holes are Not Actually Black**: Despite their name, black holes are not actually black. They are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, including light, can escape. However, the accretion disk of hot, swirling gas around a black hole can emit intense radiation, making it visible to telescopes. This radiation can be so bright that it outshines the entire galaxy that the black hole is located in.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Black Holes Come in Different Sizes**: Black holes are often thought of as massive, cosmic monsters, but they actually come in a range of sizes. Stellar black holes are formed when a star collapses in on itself and are relatively small, with masses between 1.4 and 20 times that of the sun. Supermassive black holes, on the other hand, are found at the centers of galaxies and can have masses billions or even trillions of times that of the sun. There are also intermediate-mass black holes, which have masses that fall between these two extremes.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Black Holes Can Distort Space-Time**: According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, black holes warp the fabric of space-time around them. This warping effect, known as gravitational lensing, can cause strange visual effects, such as bending and magnifying the light from distant stars. In extreme cases, it can even create multiple images of the same object or make it appear as if a star is in a different location than it actually is.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Black Holes Can Affect the Growth of Galaxies**: Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies can play a crucial role in regulating the growth of those galaxies. By controlling the amount of gas available for star formation, black holes can limit the number of new stars that are born. This, in turn, can affect the overall size and structure of the galaxy. In some cases, the energy released by a black hole can even trigger the formation of new stars by compressing nearby gas and dust.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Black Holes Can Create Powerful Jets of Energy**: Some black holes are capable of producing incredibly powerful jets of energy that can shoot out of the galaxy and into intergalactic space. These jets, which are thought to be powered by the spin of the black hole, can be thousands of light-years long and emit enormous amounts of radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays. The exact mechanism behind these jets is still not fully understood, but they are thought to be an important part of the black hole's role in shaping the surrounding galaxy and beyond.\n",

Each friend gives their recommendation based on their unique perspective and preferences (decision trees trained on different subsets of data). You then make your final decision by considering the majority opinion or averaging their suggestions (ensemble prediction).\n",
