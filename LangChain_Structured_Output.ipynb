Battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours I play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. Battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. Charging takes 35 min to full charge. I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade.\n",

Battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours I play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. Battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. Charging takes 35 min to full charge. I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade.\n",

        "result2 = structured_model.invoke(\"\"\"iPhone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 ISO AND EVERYTHING AUTO, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. Battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours I play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. Battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. Charging takes 35 min to full charge. I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade.\n",

        "* Good camera for the price could be bit better in video.\n",
        "* One of the best gaming phones does heat up but in a controlled way and cools down pretty fast.\n",
        "* Really Fast charging speed ( does heat a bit nothing to bother or just open settings - battery - charging and disable fast charging it will slightly slow down charging speed but it will decrease phone's surface temp ).\n",
        "* Good display very bright overall really good\n",

        "* Mediocre Selfie camera my old IQoo Neo 6 had better selfie's than this paid 55k for a phone and no 4k Selfie video front is the biggest downside of this phone.\n",
        "* UI is good very reliable but not as good as other Android Skins ( Just updated to android 15 did make a way better and smoother but could be better).\n",
        "* And audio transmitter has kinda bad the output is not upto to the mark with bluetooh specifically had same problem with my Neo 6 my poco f1 had really good audio Dec on board than this two new phones.\n",

Black holes are formed when a massive star collapses in on itself, creating a singularity with infinite density and zero volume. There are four types of black holes, each with different properties and formation mechanisms, including stellar, supermassive, intermediate-mass, and primordial black holes. The properties of black holes include event horizons, singularities, gravitational pull, accretion disks, and Hawking radiation. The study of black holes is an ongoing area of research, with many challenges and open questions remaining, including the information paradox and the nature of singularities.\n"
