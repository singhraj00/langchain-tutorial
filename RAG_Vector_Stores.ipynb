These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions in'), Document(metadata={'title': 'Artificial general intelligence', 'summary': 'Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothesized type of highly autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) that would match or surpass human capabilities across most or all economically valuable cognitive work. It contrasts with narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.\\nCreating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries.\\nThe timeline for achieving AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; a minority believe it may never be achieved; and another minority claims that it is already here. Notable AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton has expressed concerns about the rapid progress towards AGI, suggesting it could be achieved sooner than many expect.\\nThere is debate on the exact definition of AGI and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early forms of AGI. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.\\nContention exists over whether AGI represents an existential risk. Many experts on AI have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by AGI should be a global priority.

Many experts on AI have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by AGI should be a global priority. Others find the development of AGI to be in too remote a stage to present such a risk.\\n\\n\\n== Terminology ==\\nAGI is also known as strong AI, full AI, human-level AI, human-level intelligent AI, or general intelligent action.\\nSome academic sources reserve the term \"strong AI\" for computer programs that will experience sentience or consciousness. In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem but lacks general cognitive abilities. Some academic sources use \"weak AI\" to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.\\nRelated concepts include artificial superintelligence and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans, while the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example, similar to the agricultural or industrial revolution.\\nA framework for classifying AGI by performance and autonomy was proposed in 2023 by Google DeepMind researchers. They define five performance levels of AGI: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. For example, a competent AGI is defined as an AI that outperforms 50% of skilled adults in a wide range of non-physical tasks, and a superhuman AGI (i.e. an artificial superintelligence) is similarly defined but with a threshold of 100%. They consider large language models like ChatGPT or LLaMA 2 to be instances of emerging AGI (comparable to unskilled humans). Regarding the autonomy of AGI and associated risks, they define five levels: tool (fully in human control), consultant, collaborator, expert, and agent (fully autonomous).\\n\\n\\n== Characteristics ==\\n\\nVarious popular definitions of intelligence have been proposed. One of the leading proposals is the Turing test. However, there are other well-known definitions, and some researchers disagree with the more popular approaches.\\n\\n\\n=== Intelligence traits ===\\nResearchers generally hold that a system is required to do all of the following to be regarded as an AGI:\\n\\nreason, use strategy, solve puzzles, and make judgments under uncertainty\\nrepresent knowledge, including common sense knowledge\\nplan\\nlearn\\ncommunicate in natural language\\nif necessary, integrate these skills in completion of any given goal\\nMany interdisciplinary approaches (e.g. cognitive science, computational intelligence, and decision making) consider additional traits such as imaginat'), Document(metadata={'title': 'A.I.

With the human population in decline, advanced nations have created humanoid robots called mechas to fulfill various roles in society.\\nIn Madison, New Jersey, David, an 11-year-old prototype mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin is in suspended animation after contracting a rare disease. Initially uncomfortable with David, Monica eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol. Wanting her to love him in return, he befriends Teddy, Martin\\'s old robotic teddy bear.\\nAfter Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home, he jealously goads David into cutting off a piece of Monica\\'s hair. That night, David enters his adoptive parents\\' room, but as Monica turns over, the scissors accidentally poke her in the eye. While Henry attends to her wounds, Teddy picks up the lock of hair from the floor and places it in his pocket. During a pool party, one of Martin\\'s friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs Martin, causing both of them to fall into the pool. While Martin is rescued, David is accused of endangering others.\\nHenry convinces Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. En route, she instead spares David by abandoning him in the woods full of scrap metal and obsolete mechas. Now accompanied solely by Teddy, David recalls The Adventures of Pinocchio and decides to find the Blue Fairy to become human, which he believes will regain Monica\\'s love.\\nDavid and Teddy are captured by the \"Flesh Fair\", a traveling circus-like event at which obsolete mechas are destroyed in front of jeering crowds. About to be destroyed himself, David pleads for his life, and the audience revolts and allows David to escape with Gigolo Joe, a prostitute mecha on the run after being framed for murder.

The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet\\'s automaton created in the early 1800s. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic artificial intelligence ===\\nThe academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Artificial Intelligence research began in the 1950s with works like Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) and the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI. Since the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.\\nThe terms generative AI planning or generative planning were used in the 1980s and 1990s to refer to AI planning systems, especially computer-aided process planning, used to generate sequences of actions to reach a specified goal. Generative AI planning systems used symbolic AI methods such as state space search and constraint satisfaction and were a \"relatively mature\" technology by the early 1990s. They were used to generate crisis action plans for military use, process plans for manufacturing and decision plans such as in prototype autonomous spacecraft.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative neural nets (2014-2019) ===\\n\\nSince its inception, the field of machine learning has used both discriminative models and generative models to model a')]\n"

            "Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothesized type of highly autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) that would match or surpass human capabilities across most or all economically valuable cognitive work. It contrasts with narrow AI, which is limited to specific tasks. Artificial superintelligence (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.\n",
            "Creating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries.\n",
            "The timeline for achieving AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; a minority believe it may never be achieved; and another minority claims that it is already here. Notable AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton has expressed concerns about the rapid progress towards AGI, suggesting it could be achieved sooner than many expect.\n",
            "There is debate on the exact definition of AGI and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early forms of AGI. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.\n",
            "Contention exists over whether AGI represents an existential risk. Many experts on AI have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by AGI should be a global priority. Others find the development of AGI to be in too remote a stage to present such a risk.\n",

            "Some academic sources reserve the term \"strong AI\" for computer programs that will experience sentience or consciousness. In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem but lacks general cognitive abilities. Some academic sources use \"weak AI\" to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.\n",
            "Related concepts include artificial superintelligence and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans, while the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example, similar to the agricultural or industrial revolution.\n",
            "A framework for classifying AGI by performance and autonomy was proposed in 2023 by Google DeepMind researchers. They define five performance levels of AGI: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. For example, a competent AGI is defined as an AI that outperforms 50% of skilled adults in a wide range of non-physical tasks, and a superhuman AGI (i.e. an artificial superintelligence) is similarly defined but with a threshold of 100%. They consider large language models like ChatGPT or LLaMA 2 to be instances of emerging AGI (comparable to unskilled humans). Regarding the autonomy of AGI and associated risks, they define five levels: tool (fully in human control), consultant, collaborator, expert, and agent (fully autonomous).\n",

            "A.I. Artificial Intelligence (or simply A.I.) is a 2001 American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by Ian Watson are loosely based on the 1969 short story \"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\" by Brian Aldiss. Set in a futuristic society, the film stars Haley Joel Osment as David, a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love. Jude Law, Frances O'Connor, Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt star in supporting roles.\n",
            "Development of A.I. originally began after producer and director Stanley Kubrick acquired the rights to Aldiss's story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers, including Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson and Sara Maitland, until the mid-1990s. The film languished in development hell for years, partly because Kubrick felt that computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, which he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick died in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment for the screenplay and dedicated the film to Kubrick.\n",
            "A.I. Artificial Intelligence was released on June 29, 2001, by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $235.9 million against a budget of $90–100 million. It was also nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score (for John Williams) at the 74th Academy Awards. In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000. It has since been called one of Spielberg's best works and one of the greatest films of the 21st century, and of all time.\n",

            "In Madison, New Jersey, David, an 11-year-old prototype mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin is in suspended animation after contracting a rare disease. Initially uncomfortable with David, Monica eventually warms to him and activates his imprinting protocol. Wanting her to love him in return, he befriends Teddy, Martin's old robotic teddy bear.\n",
            "After Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home, he jealously goads David into cutting off a piece of Monica's hair. That night, David enters his adoptive parents' room, but as Monica turns over, the scissors accidentally poke her in the eye. While Henry attends to her wounds, Teddy picks up the lock of hair from the floor and places it in his pocket. During a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs Martin, causing both of them to fall into the pool. While Martin is rescued, David is accused of endangering others.\n",
            "Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. En route, she instead spares David by abandoning him in the woods full of scrap metal and obsolete mechas. Now accompanied solely by Teddy, David recalls The Adventures of Pinocchio and decides to find the Blue Fairy to become human, which he believes will regain Monica's love.\n",
            "David and Teddy are captured by the \"Flesh Fair\", a traveling circus-like event at which obsolete mechas are destroyed in front of jeering crowds. About to be destroyed himself, David pleads for his life, and the audience revolts and allows David to escape with Gigolo Joe, a prostitute mecha on the run after being framed for murder. David, Teddy and Joe go to the decadent resort town of Rouge City, where \"Dr. Know\", a holographic answer engine, directs them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of New York City and provides fairy tale informatio\n",

The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative automations has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet's automaton created in the early 1800s. Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.\n",

AGI is considered one of the definitions of strong AI.\\nCreating AGI is a primary goal of AI research and of companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta. A 2020 survey identified 72 active AGI research and development projects across 37 countries.\\nThe timeline for achieving AGI remains a subject of ongoing debate among researchers and experts. As of 2023, some argue that it may be possible in years or decades; others maintain it might take a century or longer; a minority believe it may never be achieved; and another minority claims that it is already here. Notable AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton has expressed concerns about the rapid progress towards AGI, suggesting it could be achieved sooner than many expect.\\nThere is debate on the exact definition of AGI and regarding whether modern large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are early forms of AGI. AGI is a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.\\nContention exists over whether AGI represents an existential risk. Many experts on AI have stated that mitigating the risk of human extinction posed by AGI should be a global priority. Others find the development of AGI to be in too remote a stage to present such a risk.', 'title': 'Artificial general intelligence', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence'}, page_content='Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothesized type of highly autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) that would match or surpass human capabilities across most or all economically valuable cognitive work.
